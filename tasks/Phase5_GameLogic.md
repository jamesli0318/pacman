**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Game starts with 3 lives displayed
- [ ] Life decreases on ghost collision in NORMAL state
- [ ] Pacman respawns at start position after death
- [ ] Lives display updates immediately
- [ ] Game over triggers when lives = 0
- [ ] Ghosts reset to normal state on respawn
- [ ] Score persists through respawns

### Task 44: Implement game over conditions and level completion detection
**Deliverable**: Win/lose condition logic
**Details**:
- Level complete when all dots collected
- Game over when lives reach 0
- Victory when all 10 levels completed
- Proper state transitions
**Acceptance Criteria**: Game ends correctly under all conditions
**Tests & Validation**:

- [ ] Bonus items appear randomly during gameplay
- [ ] Items disappear after timeout (10 seconds)
- [ ] Different item types have different point values
- [ ] Collection awards correct points and shows feedback
