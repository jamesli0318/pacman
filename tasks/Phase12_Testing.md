# Phase 12: Testing & Quality (Tasks 74-77)

## ðŸ§ª Phase 12: Testing & Quality (Tasks 74-77)

### Task 74: Implement caching for frequently accessed game data
**Deliverable**: Caching system
**Details**:
- Cache leaderboard data
- Cache user profiles
- Redis or in-memory caching
- Cache invalidation strategies
**Acceptance Criteria**: Frequently accessed data is cached effectively
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Redis/cache connection established successfully
- [ ] Leaderboard data cached: TTL 5 minutes
- [ ] User profiles cached: TTL 30 minutes
- [ ] Cache hit rate >80% for leaderboard requests
- [ ] Cache invalidation works on new high scores
- [ ] Fallback to database when cache unavailable
- [ ] Cache warming: popular data pre-loaded
- [ ] Memory usage monitoring: cache doesn't exceed limits
- [ ] Performance testing shows cache benefits

### Task 75: Create comprehensive unit tests for game logic components
**Deliverable**: Frontend unit tests
**Details**:
- Test game logic functions
- Test React component behavior
- Test API service layer
- Achieve >80% code coverage
**Acceptance Criteria**: Core functionality is thoroughly tested
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] `npm test` runs all unit tests successfully
- [ ] Code coverage >80%: `npm run test:coverage`
- [ ] Game logic tests: collision detection, scoring, movement
- [ ] React component tests: rendering, interactions, state
- [ ] API service tests: HTTP requests, error handling
- [ ] Mock data and services for isolated testing
- [ ] Test edge cases and error conditions
- [ ] Continuous integration runs tests on PR
- [ ] Test reports are generated and accessible

### Task 76: Add integration tests for API endpoints
**Deliverable**: Backend integration tests
**Details**:
- Test all API endpoints
- Test authentication flow
- Test database operations
- Test error scenarios
**Acceptance Criteria**: API endpoints work correctly under all conditions
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] `python manage.py test` runs all integration tests
- [ ] All API endpoints tested: auth, games, leaderboard
- [ ] Authentication flow tested: register â†’ login â†’ protected endpoints
- [ ] Database operations tested: CRUD for all models
- [ ] Error scenarios tested: 400, 401, 404, 500 responses
- [ ] Test database isolation: tests don't affect each other
- [ ] API rate limiting tested
- [ ] Score validation logic tested
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline runs tests automatically

### Task 77: Implement end-to-end tests for complete game flow
**Deliverable**: E2E test suite
**Details**:
- Test complete user journey
- Test game play scenarios
- Test leaderboard functionality
- Automated testing pipeline
**Acceptance Criteria**: Critical user flows are tested end-to-end
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] E2E tests run with Cypress/Playwright: `npm run test:e2e`
- [ ] Complete user journey: register â†’ login â†’ play â†’ submit score
- [ ] Game play scenarios: movement, scoring, level progression
- [ ] Leaderboard functionality: view rankings, personal stats
- [ ] Cross-browser testing: Chrome, Firefox, Safari
- [ ] Mobile device testing: responsive design verification
- [ ] Error handling: network failures, invalid inputs
- [ ] Performance testing: page load times, game frame rate
- [ ] Automated pipeline: tests run on deployment
