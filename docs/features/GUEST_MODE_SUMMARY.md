## How It Works

### User Flow
```
Home Page
  ├─> Click "Play as Guest"
  ├─> playAsGuest() sets guest state
  ├─> Navigate to /game
  ├─> ProtectedRoute allows access (allowGuests=true)
  ├─> Game displays with warning banner
  └─> User can play but scores not saved
```

### Technical Flow
```typescript
// 1. User clicks guest button
playAsGuest() {
  const guestId = `guest_${Date.now()}`;
  setIsGuest(true);
  setGuestData({ isGuest: true, username: guestId, displayName: 'Guest Player' });
  localStorage.setItem('isGuest', 'true');
  localStorage.setItem('guestData', JSON.stringify(guestData));
}

// 2. Route protection
<ProtectedRoute allowGuests={true}>
  // Allows: isAuthenticated || (allowGuests && isGuest)
</ProtectedRoute>

// 3. Component conditionals
{isGuest && <GuestBanner />}
{isGuest ? <BackButton /> : <LogoutButton />}
```
