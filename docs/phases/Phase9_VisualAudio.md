# Phase 9: Visual & Audio Polish (Tasks 62-66)

## ðŸŽ¨ Phase 9: Visual & Audio Polish (Tasks 62-66)

### Task 62: Add real-time leaderboard updates during gameplay
**Deliverable**: Live leaderboard updates
**Details**:
- WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
- Show when player's rank changes
- Non-intrusive notifications
- Efficient update mechanism
**Acceptance Criteria**: Leaderboard updates in real-time
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] WebSocket connection establishes correctly
- [ ] Real-time updates received during gameplay
- [ ] Rank change notifications appear appropriately
- [ ] Notifications don't interrupt gameplay
- [ ] Connection reconnects automatically on disconnect
- [ ] Polling fallback works when WebSocket unavailable
- [ ] Update frequency is balanced: not too frequent/sparse
- [ ] Performance impact minimal: <5% CPU usage
- [ ] Integration tests for real-time functionality

### Task 63: Implement API service layer with Axios for HTTP requests
**Deliverable**: API service abstraction
**Details**:
- Centralized API configuration
- Request/response interceptors
- Error handling and retry logic
- Authentication token management
**Acceptance Criteria**: All API calls go through service layer
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] All API calls use centralized service layer
- [ ] Base URL configuration works: environment-specific URLs
- [ ] Request interceptors add authentication headers automatically
- [ ] Response interceptors handle common errors (401, 500)
- [ ] Retry logic works: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
- [ ] Token refresh happens automatically on 401 errors
- [ ] Network error handling provides user-friendly messages
- [ ] Service layer is properly typed with TypeScript
- [ ] Unit tests for all interceptor logic

### Task 64: Add error handling and loading states for all API calls
**Deliverable**: Comprehensive error handling
**Details**:
- Loading spinners during API calls
- Error messages for failed requests
- Retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Fallback states for offline mode
**Acceptance Criteria**: User experience is smooth despite network issues
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Loading spinners appear during all API calls
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Retry buttons work for failed requests
- [ ] Offline mode shows appropriate fallback content
- [ ] Network error detection works reliably
- [ ] Loading states don't block user interaction unnecessarily
- [ ] Error boundaries catch and handle component errors
- [ ] Timeout handling: requests fail gracefully after 30 seconds
- [ ] User testing confirms error handling is intuitive

### Task 65: Create sprite images for Pacman, ghosts, and game items
**Deliverable**: Game sprite assets
**Details**:
- Pacman sprites for all directions
- Ghost sprites for all states and colors
- Dot, power pellet, and bonus item sprites
- Maze wall and background textures
**Acceptance Criteria**: All game elements have proper sprites
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] All sprites load without errors: check browser dev tools
- [ ] Pacman sprites exist for all 4 directions + mouth animation
- [ ] Ghost sprites: 4 colors Ã— 3 states (normal, frightened, eyes)
- [ ] Dot and power pellet sprites are clearly distinguishable
- [ ] Bonus item sprites: different fruit types
- [ ] Wall textures tile properly without visible seams
- [ ] All sprites are optimized: file sizes <50KB each
- [ ] Sprite dimensions are consistent: multiples of tile size
- [ ] Visual quality is high: crisp at game resolution

### Task 66: Implement sprite animation system with frame-based animations
**Deliverable**: Animation system
**Details**:
- Frame-based animation for Pacman movement
- Ghost animation cycles
- Power pellet blinking effect
- Smooth transitions between frames
**Acceptance Criteria**: All sprites animate smoothly
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Pacman mouth animation cycles correctly (open/close)
- [ ] Ghost animations loop smoothly
- [ ] Power pellet blinking effect is visible and appealing
- [ ] Animation timing is consistent: 8 frames per second
- [ ] Animations pause when game is paused
- [ ] Frame transitions are smooth without flickering
- [ ] Animation system performs well: <2ms per frame
- [ ] Different animation speeds work correctly
- [ ] Unit tests for animation timing logic
