## ⚡ Phase 11: Performance & Testing (Tasks 72-73)

### Task 72: Implement collision detection optimization with spatial partitioning
**Deliverable**: Optimized collision system
**Details**:
- Spatial partitioning for collision detection
- Broad phase collision culling
- Efficient data structures
- Performance profiling
**Acceptance Criteria**: Collision detection scales well with game complexity
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Spatial partitioning grid divides game area efficiently
- [ ] Broad phase culling reduces collision checks by 80%+
- [ ] Collision detection time scales O(n) not O(n²)
- [ ] Performance profiling shows optimization benefits
- [ ] Complex mazes maintain good performance
- [ ] Data structures use minimal memory overhead
- [ ] Algorithm handles edge cases: objects on grid boundaries
- [ ] Unit tests verify collision accuracy maintained
- [ ] Benchmark tests show performance improvements

### Task 73: Add database indexing for leaderboard queries optimization
**Deliverable**: Database performance optimization
**Details**:
- Index on score column for leaderboard queries
- Composite indexes for filtering
- Query optimization
- Database performance monitoring
**Acceptance Criteria**: Leaderboard queries respond quickly
**Tests & Validation**:
- [ ] Database indexes created: `CREATE INDEX idx_game_session_score ON game_session(score DESC)`
- [ ] Composite indexes for time filtering: score + completed_at
- [ ] Query execution time <50ms with 100K+ records
- [ ] Query plan analysis shows index usage
- [ ] Database explain plan: `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN SELECT ...`
- [ ] Index maintenance doesn't slow INSERT operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring shows consistent response times
- [ ] Load testing confirms scalability
- [ ] Database size monitoring: indexes don't bloat storage
