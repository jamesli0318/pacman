- [All Phases](./tasks/README.md)

### Game Architecture

#### Frontend Components
- GameBoard: HTML5 Canvas game rendering
- AuthContext: User authentication management
- MainMenu: Game navigation and options
- Leaderboard: Player rankings display

#### Backend API Endpoints
- `/api/auth/` - User authentication
- `/api/games/` - Game session management
- `/api/leaderboard/` - Player rankings

#### Game Logic
- Pacman character with keyboard controls
- 4 AI ghost types with unique behaviors
- Collision detection and scoring system
- Progressive level difficulty

## Game Features

### Scoring System
- Dots: 10 points each
- Power Pellets: 50 points each
- Ghosts: 200/400/800/1600 progressive points
- Bonus Items: 100-500 points
- Level Completion: 1000 points

### AI Ghost Behaviors
- **Red Ghost (Blinky)**: Direct chase - always targets Pacman
- **Pink Ghost (Pinky)**: Ambush - targets 4 tiles ahead of Pacman
- **Blue Ghost (Inky)**: Patrol - alternates between chase and scatter
- **Orange Ghost (Clyde)**: Random movement with distance-based behavior

### Level Progression
- 10 unique maze layouts
- Progressive difficulty: ghost speed increases, power pellet duration decreases
- Ghost count progression: 1‚Üí2‚Üí3‚Üí4 ghosts across levels
